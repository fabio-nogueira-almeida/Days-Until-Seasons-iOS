Days Until Seasons is a project that I started for some personal reasons.
Sometimes I need to know what is the current seasons and what is the next season for treatment of bonsais and others plants that I really love. For a healthy growth we need to know the season for apply fertilizer corretly.

So I think the focus on this app is show the information on the **Widget** and **Apple Watch** Screen. And that is what I made.

### Studying about Seasons

For creating the app I search about some information about the Word's Seasons and I find some great.
Word's Seasons had two type of Seasons. *Meteorological* and *Astronomical*.
Our app will work with **Meteorological Seasons** and with distincting of which *hemisphere the user will be*. Yes, each hemisphere has your on Meteorological seasons. So, if the user location is on Northern Hemisphere, we will set the corretly seasons for that location.
