#Days Until Seasons

![Alt text](Design/Days until Seasons - Mockup.png)

Days Until Seasons is a project that I started for some personal reasons.
Sometimes I need to know what is the current seasons and what is the next season for treatment of bonsais and others plants that I really love. For a healthy growth we need to know the season for apply fertilizer corretly.

So I think the focus on this app is show the information on the **Widget** and **Apple Watch** Screen. And that is what I made.

The app will be on Apple store after the apple review. I will put the link in this page when aproved it.

### Technology used in this project

* Writing with Obj-c and Swift
*	Apple Watch
	*	Page-Based Interface
	*	Glance
*	Today Extension (Widget)
*	Create our own Cocoa Touch Framework
*	Core Location (we get the user Localization for defining the current Hemisphere)
*	Internationalization
*	Unit Tests
*	Google Analitycs
*	Facebook Parse and Analitycs
*	CI with Travis ( as soon as possible )
*	Sketch 3 Design ( all arquives from sketch 3 is inside the project )

### Studying about Seasons

For creating the app I search about some information about the Word's Seasons and I find some great.
Word's Seasons had two type of Seasons. *Meteorological* and *Astronomical*.
Our app will work with **Meteorological Seasons** and with distincting of which *hemisphere the user will be*. Yes, each hemisphere has your on Meteorological seasons. So, if the user location is on Northern Hemisphere, we will set the corretly seasons for that location
